The neural network model has six input variables (suhuRuangan, suhuAwalBaterai, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5) and two outputs (lastSOC and lastSuhu). It uses ReLU activation for neurons and optimizes weights with the Adam optimizer, aiming to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) for improved performance in multilinear regression tasks.
The system will generate random values for the duration variable at each current level 100,000 times. After obtaining the predicted increases in SOC and temperature, the parameters that yield the highest SOC increase and the lowest temperature increase, considering a minimum predicted SOC of 80%, will be used as references in the application of fuzzy logic.

Fuzzy logic is utilized to optimize charging duration while considering SOC and temperature to maximize SOC with minimal temperature increase. The system employs trapezoidal membership functions for three linguistic variables: SOC, temperature, and duration, each having low and high linguistic sets. Fuzzy logic rules are defined using 'if-then' statements, as shown in image and Table below.

The final step in the fuzzy logic method is the defuzzification process, which involves converting the output results of fuzzy inference into a single concrete value. In this experiment, the defuzzification method employed is the Tsukamoto method, which involves calculating the centroid.
