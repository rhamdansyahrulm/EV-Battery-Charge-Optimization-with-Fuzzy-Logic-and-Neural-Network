# **EV Battery Optimization with Fuzzy Logic and Neural Network**

<p align="justify">
&emsp;&emsp;The outcomes of this research demonstrate the successful implementation of a neural network model in recognizing battery charging patterns and predicting the state of charge (SOC) value, as well as the final charging temperature, based on the duration parameter at different current levels within the MCC charging method. The results of this study showcase the achievement of an SOC value of 83% within a charging duration of 43 minutes, while maintaining the battery temperature at an optimal level of approximately 35.85°C. Comparatively, this method yields a 3.38% increase in SOC compared to the conventional constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) method, with a marginal temperature rise of 0.41oC.

&emsp;&emsp;In its execution, there are several processes involved, including planning, simulation design, machine learning model creation, testing, and evaluation. Here are the steps taken in the process:
</p>

### **1. Database Creation and Management**

| Battery Initial Temp (°C) | Room Temp (°C) | t1 (s) | t2 (s) | t3 (s) | t4 (s) | Final Battery SOC (%) | Final Battery Temp (°C) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

<p align="justify">
&emsp;&emsp;The table above is an example of the dataset required during the final project development process. Variables such as roomTemperature, initialBatteryTemperature, t1, t2, t3, and t4 are parameters used in running the Simulink simulation and also serve as features in the machine learning process. On the other hand, lastSOC and lastTemperature are values generated from the simulation process and will be used as targets in machine learning model creation.

| Variable            | Description                                                                  |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Room Temp`     | This variable represents the room temperature in Kelvin (K) during the simulation. It serves as an environmental factor affecting the battery charging process. |
| `Battery Initial Temp` | This variable indicates the initial temperature of the battery in Kelvin (K) before the charging process begins. It is an important parameter as it influences the charging behavior. |
| `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, `t4` | These are the time durations in seconds (s) for the different steps in the charging process. |
| `Last SOC`      | This variable indicates the State of Charge (SOC) of the battery as a percentage (%) at the end of the charging process. SOC represents the amount of charge stored in the battery. |
| `Last Temp`     | This variable represents the temperature of the battery in Kelvin (K) at the conclusion of the charging process. It reflects the final temperature of the battery after charging. |

&emsp;&emsp; Here is also a representation of the correlation between variables in the data distribution. Based on the heatmap graph, it can be observed that each step duration correlates positively with SOC and the final temperature in the MCC battery charging process. However, in subsequent durations, the correlation with the target variables decreases. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the correlation values indicates the capability of the feature variables for prediction.

&emsp;&emsp; The image above displays the pattern of data distribution between feature variables and the target. Based on the graph, it's evident that the correlation is not optimal due to the presence of outliers affecting the correlation results. Therefore, data preprocessing to handle outliers is necessary before training the neural network model.

&emsp;&emsp; Based on the table, it can be concluded that the charging duration parameters at each current level are capable of producing optimal State of Charge (SOC) and final temperature, where the SOC value is above 80% with a final temperature below 40°C. Additionally, the prediction results achieved using neural network and fuzzy logic are relatively close to the simulation results, with a final SOC error below 2% and a final temperature error below 1%.

<p align="justify">
&emsp;&emsp; The use of fuzzy logic in selecting the final parameters has proven effective in reducing the final battery temperature compared to using parameters that yield the maximum SOC. Additionally, this method also improves the final SOC compared to using parameters that yield the minimum temperature. However, the use of fuzzy logic does not provide a significant difference in the rate of increase of SOC and final temperature at each time step. The graphs presented below show a time series comparison of the fast charging battery process using the three parameters for each initial battery surface temperature variable.
