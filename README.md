# EV-Battery-Charge-Optimization-with-Fuzzy-Logic-and-Neural-Network
Explore the world of electric vehicle battery optimization, where I simulate and fine-tune charging strategies based on temperature and State of Charge (SOC). I employ advanced techniques like Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks to achieve peak performance and efficiency in electric vehicle battery charging.
